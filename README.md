# About
Sentiment analysis is the process of determining and classifying the emotional tone or polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in a piece of text or speech.

# Data Analysis
We performed thorough data analysis on a dataset containing various features of tweets like, sentiments, entities and more. Our analysis includes:

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Visualization of Key Insights

# Machine Learning Model
To predict sentiments, we developed a machine-learning model. We used a dataset split into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation. The model includes the following steps:

# Feature Engineering
Model Selection (SVM model)
Hyperparameter Tuning
Evaluation Metrics (Recall, Precision, f1-score)

# Getting Started
To use or contribute to this project, follow the instructions below:
